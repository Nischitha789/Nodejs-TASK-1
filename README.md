# NodeJs 
** Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

** it is designed to be efficient and scalable, making it well-suited for building server-side and networked applications.

*Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, the same engine that powers Google Chrome, and it uses a non-blocking, event-driven architecture that makes it ideal for handling asynchronous tasks and I/O operations.
